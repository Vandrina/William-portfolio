# William McGuire Portfolio — Project Notes

Last updated: 2026

---

## Active Todo

### Images
- [ ] Choose hero slideshow images (3 total) — William to select
- [ ] Choose one representative image per discipline card (6 cards)
- [ ] Choose one representative image per client card (10 cards on homepage)
- [ ] Generate thumbnails (run `generate_thumbnails.sh`) and push to GitHub
- [ ] Update portfolio.html to use thumbnails in grid, full images in lightbox only
- [ ] Upload animation/video files when ready — add to manifest

### Code & Features
- [ ] Fix AND/OR filter logic bug — switching logic does not affect currently filtered results
- [ ] Build 404.html router for clean slug URLs (`/microsoft` → `portfolio.html?client=microsoft`)
- [ ] Add lazy loading to gallery grid images
- [ ] Test URL parameter deep linking end to end once thumbnails are in place

### Pages Still To Build
- [ ] About page
- [ ] Contact page (decide on system: form service, email link, or both)
- [ ] Custom 404 error page with site navigation intact
- [ ] Shop landing page or "coming soon" — decision pending on whether to remove shop links before go-live or build a placeholder

### Design Decisions Pending (William to decide)
- [ ] Filter UI: keep both active button highlights AND active tag row, or choose one?
  - Option A: buttons only — keep View All + OR/AND in right column
  - Option B: active tag row only — relocate OR/AND, remove View All
- [ ] Shop links: keep visible (links to williammcguire.shop) or hide until shop is live?
- [ ] Client cards on homepage: show all clients or curated selection only?

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up custom domain (williammcguire.net) on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Decide on host migration from Porkbun (Cloudways or similar — better I/O, no inode limits)
- [ ] WordPress site on Porkbun: keep as staging, migrate, or deprecate?

## Completed
- [x] Repo created and deployed to GitHub Pages (vandrina.github.io/William-portfolio)
- [x] 344 images organized into discipline folders and pushed

- [x] portfolio.html built with filter bar, masonry gallery, lightbox

## Known Bugs
- AND/OR toggle button works visually but does not affect filtered output
- Homepage discipline/client card links currently load full unfiltered gallery (thumbnail + lazy load fix will resolve load issue; URL param already correct)
